This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparisons.  The `==` operator performs loose comparison, leading to unexpected results when comparing strings and numbers. In the example below, a string '10' is loosely equal to an integer 10, but strictly unequal (`!==`). This can cause errors if the code expects strict type matching.

```php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Loosely equal\n"; // This will execute
}

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strictly equal\n"; // This will NOT execute
}
```
